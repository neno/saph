trace","description":"<p><em>&quot;The performance is an attempt to reflect on the soundscape of the city and on the creative process of all the elements composing it. Relating to Shanghai, let&rsquo;s imagine a complex layering of sounds, confusing and sometimes annoying sounds, without a clear identity and form. Everything looks like a racket and a total uproar generated by the multitude of people populating the city. A city in continuous and repeated movement, movement itself creating sound. So one would not exist without the existence of the other and vice versa. The work aims to examine such a process and the close relationship that unites the two elements in question. The performance is divided into three different periods related by a single, unvarying reading. First the performer emits a variety of sounds through the movements of his body which in turn sets up the visual-digital real-time scene through the use of software, microphones and sensors arranged in space. After that these noises will be converted into a set of sounds which can be controlled, handled and managed by the performer. The setting is visually presented with strong, immersive and enthralling features progressing towards an ideal. Finally the set of starting, disturbing and confusing sounds will change shape becoming a harmonic and melodic track with which the dancer will establish a rhythmic and fluid interaction; in fact he is the creator of such a substantial process in which he lives. The work aims to let you think how sound is produced within a urban context, where noises become the best interpreters of the identity of man; he lives in certain places, spaces, environments where a sound produces and plays another sound within a process of endless chain reaction.<\/em>&quot; Artist: Mart\u00ecn Romeo Dancer: Walker Ley Music: Stefano D&rsquo;Alessio<\/p>","traceImage":"martin_romeo_sound_production_sound_vm.jpg","pdf":"","pdfTitle":"","artist":{"name":"Mart\u00ecn Romeo","born":"1986","nationality":"Italy","inResidenceFrom":"2015-07-01 00:00:00","inResidenceTo":"2015-09-28 00:00:00","profileImage":"romeo_martin_6vm.jpg"},"traceImages":[{"title":"Sound Production Sound, Video documentary, Interactive dance performance, Duration: 5\u201938\u2019\u2019 ","filename":"martin_romeo_sound_production_sound_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Sound Production Sound, Video documentary, Interactive dance performance, Duration: 5\u201938\u2019\u2019 ","filename":"martin_romeo_sound_production_sound_01vm_0.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Sound Production Sound, Video documentary, Interactive dance performance, Duration: 5\u201938\u2019\u2019 ","filename":"","BrighcoveVideId":"46270"}],"personalWorks":[{"title":"Season 1","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season1.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 2","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season2.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 3","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"","VimeoVideId":"161227438"},{"title":"Season 4","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season4.jpg","VimeoVideId":""}]},"33":{"id":33,"category":"visualarts","title":"Mathilde Walter Clark - trace","description":"<div><em>&quot;Sometimes, when outsiders came to visit our studios, I was biting my nails in room 22. My room was full of invisible things. How was I to point to the richness so that the visitor could see? I soon found out that there was no reason to panic. No one came to my room. They all wanted to visit the visual artists. I do not blame them. I also wanted to visit the visual artists. Their studios were interesting, they were filled with wind-up horses and helium balloons and ceramic sticks. Underpants that read: ADIOS. Live silk worms that crawled around on Chairman Mao jackets. It made me think about what it is that I do. It made me think about the magic of reading. Literature is unique among the arts because the actual doing of the work is shared between the author and the reader. If I see a film there is a director who has decided how the heroine looks, how roads, the houses, the world, everything look. The visual artist has decided how the visual artwork looks. The composer how the music sounds. A book is different. On the pages there are words. The writer put them there. They resemble the visual arts in that they form an image of sorts, black letters on a white page. The resemble music in that they have a sound. But it takes a reader to unfold the words into something unforgettable. As I read the invisible becomes visible in my imagination. What I unfold (or what is magically unfolding for me) is not the same as what the writer imagined. Reading is perfectly intimate and wild, something completely private. It cannot be separated from my own experience and my own imagination. Still, I don&rsquo;t imagine just anything. Only what these particular words had me imagine.<\/em><\/div><div><em>A reader is a special creature. Reading takes time. To unfold worlds in one&rsquo;s imagination takes patience. But it can also be a indescribably rewarding work. I decided to make a tribute to the reader. My trace is a small book of maps on some of the invisible things I had worked with in room 22. There are ten maps to fold out. The maps show the invisible things - IMAGINARY OBJECTS - impressions, scenes, places, events, vistas. I write what is on the map, and then the reader folds it out and see it. It is a celebration of the magic of reading.&quot;<\/em><\/div>","traceImage":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_2_vm_0.jpg","pdf":"","pdfTitle":"","artist":{"name":"Mathilde Walter Clark","born":"1970","nationality":"Denmark","inResidenceFrom":"2016-04-02 00:00:00","inResidenceTo":"2016-06-29 00:00:00","profileImage":"mathilde_walter_clark_portrait_1vm.jpg"},"traceImages":[{"title":"Maps of IMAGINARY OBJECTS* in room 22, (*Things, impressions, scenes, sites, events & vistas  Artist book), Writing, cutting, gluing, H: 15.6 cm x W: 11.2 cm x D: 1.9 cm","filename":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_2_vm_0.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Maps of IMAGINARY OBJECTS* in room 22, (*Things, impressions, scenes, sites, events & vistas  Artist book), Writing, cutting, gluing, H: 15.6 cm x W: 11.2 cm x D: 1.9 cm","filename":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_1_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Maps of IMAGINARY OBJECTS* in room 22, (*Things, impressions, scenes, sites, events & vistas  Artist book), Writing, cutting, gluing, H: 15.6 cm x W: 11.2 cm x D: 1.9 cm","filename":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_3_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""}],"personalWorks":[{"title":"Season 1","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season1.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 2","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season2.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 3","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"","VimeoVideId":"161227438"},{"title":"Season 4","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season4.jpg","VimeoVideId":""}]},"34":{"id":34,"category":"visualarts","title":"Matthias Liechti -
