In &ldquo;An Open Life - Joseph Campbell in Conversation with Michael Toms,&rdquo; Campbell said: &ldquo;I really do think you can take clues from teachers &ndash; I know you can. But, you see, the traditional Oriental idea is that the student should submit absolutely to the teacher. The guru actually assumes responsibility for the student&rsquo;s moral life, and this is total giving. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite proper for a Western person. One of the big spiritual truths for the West is that each of us is a unique creature, and consequently has a unique path.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p><p><em>As a woman who is both &lsquo;oriental&rsquo; and &lsquo;western&rsquo; (of Chinese descent and born in the U.S.), I am looking for story that combines these two worlds, rather than dichotomizes them. That is, how can a hero (or a person, or a character in a book) &lsquo;submit absolutely&rsquo; to something and still maintain or cultivate an individuality? As I planned and outlined my novel, I focused a great deal on the monomyth and how it manifests itself in a female protagonist of Chinese and American origin.<\/em><\/p>","traceImage":"elysha_shine_chang_trace_vm3.jpg","pdf":"","pdfTitle":"","artist":{"name":"Elysha Chang","born":"1987","nationality":"United States","inResidenceFrom":"2016-09-12 00:00:00","inResidenceTo":"2017-01-30 00:00:00","profileImage":"elysha_shine_chang_portrait_vm.jpg"},"traceImages":[{"title":"Open Studio Poster, print on paper, signed, H: 42 cm, W: 29,7 cm","filename":"elysha_shine_chang_trace_vm3.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Open Studio Poster, print on paper, signed, H: 42 cm, W: 29,7 cm, detail","filename":"elysha_shine_chang_trace_vm4.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Planning Sheet, Hand written on paper, H: 21 cm, W: 29,7 cm","filename":"elysha_shine_chang_trace_vm2.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Open Studio Poster, Planning Sheet","filename":"elysha_shine_chang_trace_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""}],"personalWorks":[{"title":"Season 1","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season1.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 2","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season2.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 3","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"","VimeoVideId":"161227438"},{"title":"Season 4","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season4.jpg","VimeoVideId":""}]},"58":{"id":58,"category":"visualarts","title":"Eva Borner -

trace","description":"<p><em>&quot;The performance is an attempt to reflect on the soundscape of the city and on the creative process of all the elements composing it. Relating to Shanghai, let&rsquo;s imagine a complex layering of sounds, confusing and sometimes annoying sounds, without a clear identity and form. Everything looks like a racket and a total uproar generated by the multitude of people populating the city. A city in continuous and repeated movement, movement itself creating sound. So one would not exist without the existence of the other and vice versa. The work aims to examine such a process and the close relationship that unites the two elements in question. The performance is divided into three different periods related by a single, unvarying reading. First the performer emits a variety of sounds through the movements of his body which in turn sets up the visual-digital real-time scene through the use of software, microphones and sensors arranged in space. After that these noises will be converted into a set of sounds which can be controlled, handled and managed by the performer. The setting is visually presented with strong, immersive and enthralling features progressing towards an ideal. Finally the set of starting, disturbing and confusing sounds will change shape becoming a harmonic and melodic track with which the dancer will establish a rhythmic and fluid interaction; in fact he is the creator of such a substantial process in which he lives. The work aims to let you think how sound is produced within a urban context, where noises become the best interpreters of the identity of man; he lives in certain places, spaces, environments where a sound produces and plays another sound within a process of endless chain reaction.<\/em>&quot; Artist: Mart\u00ecn Romeo Dancer: Walker Ley Music: Stefano D&rsquo;Alessio<\/p>","traceImage":"martin_romeo_sound_production_sound_vm.jpg","pdf":"","pdfTitle":"","artist":{"name":"Mart\u00ecn Romeo","born":"1986","nationality":"Italy","inResidenceFrom":"2015-07-01 00:00:00","inResidenceTo":"2015-09-28 00:00:00","profileImage":"romeo_martin_6vm.jpg"},"traceImages":[{"title":"Sound Production Sound, Video documentary, Interactive dance performance, Duration: 5\u201938\u2019\u2019 ","filename":"martin_romeo_sound_production_sound_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Sound Production Sound, Video documentary, Interactive dance performance, Duration: 5\u201938\u2019\u2019 ","filename":"martin_romeo_sound_production_sound_01vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Sound Production Sound, Video documentary, Interactive dance performance, Duration: 5\u201938\u2019\u2019 ","filename":"","BrighcoveVideId":"46270"}],"personalWorks":[{"title":"Season 1","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season1.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 2","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season2.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 3","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"","VimeoVideId":"161227438"},{"title":"Season 4","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season4.jpg","VimeoVideId":""}]},"133":{"id":133,"category":"visualarts","title":"Mathilde Walter Clark - trace","description":"<div><em>&quot;Sometimes, when outsiders came to visit our studios, I was biting my nails in room 22. My room was full of invisible things. How was I to point to the richness so that the visitor could see? I soon found out that there was no reason to panic. No one came to my room. They all wanted to visit the visual artists. I do not blame them. I also wanted to visit the visual artists. Their studios were interesting, they were filled with wind-up horses and helium balloons and ceramic sticks. Underpants that read: ADIOS. Live silk worms that crawled around on Chairman Mao jackets. It made me think about what it is that I do. It made me think about the magic of reading. Literature is unique among the arts because the actual doing of the work is shared between the author and the reader. If I see a film there is a director who has decided how the heroine looks, how roads, the houses, the world, everything look. The visual artist has decided how the visual artwork looks. The composer how the music sounds. A book is different. On the pages there are words. The writer put them there. They resemble the visual arts in that they form an image of sorts, black letters on a white page. The resemble music in that they have a sound. But it takes a reader to unfold the words into something unforgettable. As I read the invisible becomes visible in my imagination. What I unfold (or what is magically unfolding for me) is not the same as what the writer imagined. Reading is perfectly intimate and wild, something completely private. It cannot be separated from my own experience and my own imagination. Still, I don&rsquo;t imagine just anything. Only what these particular words had me imagine.<\/em><\/div><div><em>A reader is a special creature. Reading takes time. To unfold worlds in one&rsquo;s imagination takes patience. But it can also be a indescribably rewarding work. I decided to make a tribute to the reader. My trace is a small book of maps on some of the invisible things I had worked with in room 22. There are ten maps to fold out. The maps show the invisible things - IMAGINARY OBJECTS - impressions, scenes, places, events, vistas. I write what is on the map, and then the reader folds it out and see it. It is a celebration of the magic of reading.&quot;<\/em><\/div>","traceImage":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_2_vm.jpg","pdf":"","pdfTitle":"","artist":{"name":"Mathilde Walter Clark","born":"1970","nationality":"Denmark","inResidenceFrom":"2016-04-02 00:00:00","inResidenceTo":"2016-06-29 00:00:00","profileImage":"mathilde_walter_clark_portrait_1vm.jpg"},"traceImages":[{"title":"Maps of IMAGINARY OBJECTS* in room 22, (*Things, impressions, scenes, sites, events & vistas  Artist book), Writing, cutting, gluing, H: 15.6 cm x W: 11.2 cm x D: 1.9 cm","filename":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_2_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Maps of IMAGINARY OBJECTS* in room 22, (*Things, impressions, scenes, sites, events & vistas  Artist book), Writing, cutting, gluing, H: 15.6 cm x W: 11.2 cm x D: 1.9 cm","filename":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_1_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""},{"title":"Maps of IMAGINARY OBJECTS* in room 22, (*Things, impressions, scenes, sites, events & vistas  Artist book), Writing, cutting, gluing, H: 15.6 cm x W: 11.2 cm x D: 1.9 cm","filename":"mathilde_walter_clark_trace1_3_vm.jpg","BrighcoveVideId":""}],"personalWorks":[{"title":"Season 1","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season1.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 2","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season2.jpg","VimeoVideId":""},{"title":"Season 3","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"","VimeoVideId":"161227438"},{"title":"Season 4","description":"Coming out of a series of paintings called \"Seasons\"","filename":"season4.jpg","VimeoVideId":""}]},"134":{"id":134,"category":"visualarts","title":"Matthias Liechti -

In this project, Phil Akashi explores the Confucian notion of the great unity \/ &quot;\u5927\u540c&quot;, and observes how modern China is embracing diversity as an asset for a harmonious world. For the second chapter of the project, Phil Akashi traveled to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to meet several ethnic minorities such as the Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uyghur and to create some innovative street art pieces in the mountains and in the nature. Located at the extreme west of China and larger than Alaska, Xinjiang is a land of extremes and bounty with a complicated, intriguing history, a complex network of ethnic groups, and a rich artistic, musical, gastronomic heritage. During the journey, Phil met the Uyghur ethnic group in the Taklimakan desert where he spray-painted on traditional Uyghur silk on a caravan of camels.

The texts were written and re-written between January and April 2014 in Shanghai.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>2. <strong>YEZZEN<\/strong>, an audio recording of our collaborative peformance with Christian Berg that took place in Basement 6 on June 10th and was re-performed during an O!Collective event on June 15th.<\/div><div>YEZZEN is a collaboration between Bulgarian playwright\/poet Yasen Vasilev and Swedish musician Christian Berg (KITE). It is an intense improvisational 20-minute spoken word performance combining original contemporary poetry in Bulgarian with noise created live at place. Thus with the audience not really understanding the language the focus is moved from meaning to sound and words start to have almost ritual functions.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>3. <strong>THE WALLED IN ONES<\/strong>, a video recording of the first performative reading in English of my debut play that was originally written in Bulgarian and first produced in Sofia in the fall of 2012.<br \/>Cast includes Aaron Garcia, Awesta Zarif and Bj\u00f6rn Dahlman. It was performed twice on June 16th in Room 39 of the Swatch Art Peace Hotel as part of my open studio. Colette Fu and Mauro Andrizzi shot a video of the performance, the sound and the editing were done by Salome MC.<br \/>Synopsis of the play: A writer blurs the line between dream and reality as he struggles to understand if his sickness is the result of his writing or the other way around.&nbsp;Bastian Bertello moves into an old house to try to stop writing. A young woman named Ivy who already lives there, convinces him to let her stay and take care of the house and soon they fall in love. The neighbour Isadora Graf suggests Ivy does not exist and claims the house has been empty for years, the owners are dead and there are no heirs. Bertello starts to grow suspicious and tries to find out what happened to Ivy&#39;s parents. Instead, she tells him the story of The Walled In Ones &ndash; thirteen women sentenced to death after being accused of witchcraft. She hears whispers and footsteps and warns him that the house is dangerous. Bertello doesn&rsquo;t believe her and accuses her of making things up as their relationship begins to fall apart. After a strange dream, Bertello wakes up and finds Ivy&rsquo;s dead body. He asks the priest for help but when they arrive, Ivy&rsquo;s body is missing. The priest also shares with Bertello his versions of the mysterious events that happened around the house. Bertello becomes more and more delusional blaming Isadora for hiding the body and eventually becomes one of The Walled in Ones.&nbsp;<\/div><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><span style=\"line-height: 20.4px;\">Additional work:<\/span><\/p><p><strong>Borgestriptych - Filmed theater play by Yasen Vasilev<\/strong>:<br \/>Borgestriptych&nbsp;is Yasen Vasilev&#39;s second text for theatre. It was written in 2012, developed at a workshop in Sofia conducted by The Drama League of New York and produced for the first time in English at Swatch Art Peace Hotel, Shanghai in 2014. A contemporary text for theatre,&nbsp;Borgestriptych&nbsp;draws inspiration from three short stories by Jorge Luis Borges but also from the life and general oeuvre of the Argentinian writer. Four performers are four different versions of Borges, metamorphosing into his many characters who are ultimately the same person constantly talking to himself. In the world of this play library and universe are one and the same and the spaces and their dwellers are entirely built of letters.<\/p><p>Borgestriptych, directed by its author, premiered as half-live performance, half-video installation on Halloween night 2014. The piece is devised so that the six scenes of the play fit the six floors of the Swatch Art Peace Hotel, starting from lobby and finishing up on the rooftop. On the night of Oct31, as part of the 3-year anniversary celebration of the residency and the opening of the Faces&amp;Traces exhibition, five scenes of the piece were screened on five different floors and the 6th scene was continuously performed live throughout the night on floor R in The Good Fortune Suite. Then on Nov 1st the full live performance had its first two full runs as a site-specific immersive theatre piece with the audience moving along with the actors from lobby to rooftop.<\/p><p><em><span style=\"line-height: 20.4px;\">BORGESTRIPTYCH&nbsp;<\/span>Credits:<\/em><\/p><div><em>CAST AND CREW<\/em><\/div><div><em>PHILIP BOAFO as MAN AT THE RECEPTION DESK, EDITOR, CHAUFFEUR, BLACK<\/em><\/div><div><em>FINNEGAN, POLICE OFFICER, NEWSPAPER SELLER<\/em><\/div><div><em>AARON GARCIA as ERIC L\u00d6NNROT<\/em><\/div><div><em>TYRONE RUTH as FRANZ TREVIRANUS<\/em><\/div><div><em>JEROME MAZET as RED SHARLAH, MARCELLO YARMOLINSKY, DANIEL SIMON<\/em><\/div><div><em>ASEVEDO, GINSBERG-GRIFIUS<\/em><\/div><div><em>Costumes JIANLIN CHENG<\/em><\/div><div><em>Assistant Director AWESTA ZARIF<\/em><\/div><div><em>Director of Photography SIMON BETHKE<\/em><\/div><div><em>Written by YASEN VASILEV<\/em><\/div><div><em>inspired by the work and life of J.
